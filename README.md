# Frogger Clone

This project is a simple clone of the classic arcade game, built as part of Udacity's Front-end Nanodegree, using html, css and plain javascript.

## Instructions

To play, simply point your brower at index.html. 

Once the game board is loaded, use the arrow keys (up :arrow_up: down
:arrow_down: left :arrow_left: right :arrow_right: ) to safely navigate your player from the grass at the bottom of the screen, to the water at the top of the screen. Be ware of the very mean beetles!
